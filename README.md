# blogify-platform
This is a full-stack blogging platform built using React, Node.js, Express.js, and Tailwind CSS for the frontend and backend. The project demonstrates how users can register, log in, and manage blogs efficiently. It uses two backend implementations: one with Express.js and MongoDB, and another with HTTP and MySQL.
